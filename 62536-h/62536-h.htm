<p class="drop-cap">GREAT commotion reigned among
the Immortals, as a most unprecedented
event had convulsed
and shaken the inhabitants
of the city of Swarga in
the heaven of Indra.</p>

<p>Three of the most powerful and most beautiful
of all the gods, Indra, Surya and Soma, had fallen
foolishly, hopelessly in love with a mortal woman.
She was the daughter of a Brahmin priest, a twice-born
man, and so fair was she that the King of
Benares described her as a morsel fit for the
gods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image006.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>The court poet had sung her beauty in a song
which ran thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou canst behold her beauty but once and
nevermore, for like the splendor of Surya it blinds
thee for thy daring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus I, from the profound depth of my blindness
will describe to thee in words as poor as my
fancy is rich, what I saw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her countenance is pale and sad as the white
lotus in full bloom when it is kissed by the rays
of the love-lorn moon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her hair is black as the thoughts of Yama,
and it is so delicate and sensitive that it reflects all
her moods, her most intimate thoughts, and thou
canst observe her hair if thou darest not glance at
her face. Her eyes are as deep as the Bottomless
Well, and when she gazes at thee for a while thou
feelest that she could absorb thee as thou dost
the perfume of a flower. But if thou couldst
only read in her eyes thou wouldst find there the
source of all the Blessings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image008.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>&#8220;When her eyelids close and open slowly they
seem to yawn indifference or contempt, and the
eyebrows are arches which keep the eyes from
irradiating the Universe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her mouth is sometimes paler than the palest
coral, at other times darker than a bloody wound,
and it is more flexible than the thoughts of a courtier.</p>

<p>&#8220;When her lips smile at thee thou art certain
that thou hast found a new heaven, for she uncovers
another Milky Way; but when they scorn or
show anger then hadst thou better never show thy
face again, for sorrow will eat thy soul as leprosy
corrodes a body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her hands are so minute and graceful that
at the sight of them the bengalies weep and pine
away in envy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her feet are so dainty and soft that the flowers
and grass which she treads imagine that the butterfly
has just kissed them gently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image010.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>&#8220;All her movements are so beautiful that they
seem to be singing to an incessant melody of
rhythm, and they are so numerous in their perfection
that shouldst thou cast a statue for each
gesture of hers thou wouldst have to go to other
planets for new marble or precious metal and still
thou wouldst not achieve thy task.</p>

<p>&#8220;This I saw and I was blinded for my daring,
but nevertheless had I as many lives as there are
stars in heaven, and were each life as long as a
world-cycle, still would I gladly become blind at
the beginning of each cycle could I cast one solitary
glance at her immortal beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus spake the Poet, and verily only the gods
had dared fall in love with Uttara. Surya, the
God of the Sun, appeared in the morning in a
blaze of golden flames, and at noon his rays became
so ardent that Uttara had to run under cover
to protect herself against his passion.</p>

<p>More than once was Indra obliged to send to
his faithful cloud-gods, the Maruts, to cover the
inextinguishable radiance of the impetuous Surya.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image012.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>In the evening, as if ashamed of his behavior,
his face became redder and redder, and only then
could Uttara look modestly into his eye.</p>

<p>Soma courted her more gently but with more
subtlety and his pure and tormented features full
of sighs would make Uttara sometimes grow pensive
and absorbed. When she chastely lowered
her eyes he reflected and scintillated on the silent
lagoons or on the sea all his unappeased and trembling
desires. But when Soma became too insinuating
the jealous Indra called forth the Maruts
and the Apas, thus forcing Soma to peep from
behind the riding Maruts agitated and disturbed.</p>

<p>Indra had the preponderance over his rivals
because of his presence in day time and at night
time. In the morning he appeared cold and
pale with jealousy, only at evenings was he
supreme, absorbing all the splendor cast by the
departing Surya. At night he reflected all his
darker moods as he felt that Soma even if a
smaller was a more dangerous rival than the blustering
Surya; only when Soma was absent did Indra
dot his dark blue dress with countless scintillating
gems and over his shoulder threw his gauzy
scarf, the Milky Way.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image014.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Uttara, like a true woman, did not show
partiality toward any of her admirers, nor accede
to their courtship and the three Immortals were as
much at sea as if they had been common, every-day
mortals.</p>

<p>Indrani, Indra&#8217;s wife was the last to be informed
of his unfaithfulness and she decided to see for
herself what the woman who dared to compete with
her in her husband&#8217;s affection, looked like.</p>

<p>She saw Uttara and did not wonder at Indra&#8217;s
infatuation, but resolved to end this royal game
of hide and seek. Ere Uttara had had time to
breathe again she had been transformed into water
in the sacrificial cup which her father was to use the
following day in performing the sacred rites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image016.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>The despair of the three love-lorn deities was
indescribable and each one of them tried his utmost
to save Uttara from destruction.</p>

<p>Surya, violent and intense, tried with all the
ardour of his torrid rays to vaporize her and carry
her up to the heavens. But all his efforts were
fruitless. Soma, heart-stricken and unnerved,
could only sing to her a forlorn and disconsolate
complaint, but he also sang in vain.</p>

<p>Indra attempted several stratagems with all
the power of his daring passion and finally
begged Uttara to confess whom she loved, as this
confession only could save her from extinction.
And Uttara spoke to him trembling with emotion,
&#8220;O Indra, I love thee only; for thou alone art
my love, my god! I do not wish to be saved and
become mortal again, but if thou lovest me deeply,
absorb me, take my body, my soul, all, for I
am thine forever!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Indra reflected his beauty into hers, embraced
her fondly, desperately, with all his might,
and so powerful and intimate was the desire that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the sacrificial water absorbed Indra&#8217;s image.
When later Uttara&#8217;s father lifted the bowl to perform
the rite he found in place of the sacrificial
liquid a blue stone of the color of the sky in
springtime, vivid and flawless, the Turquoise.</p>
